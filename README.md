# Number Grid Challenge
"Number Grid Challenge" is a deceptively simple-looking game that offers an incredibly challenging experience. The objective is to arrange a grid of numbers in ascending order, but the catch is that numbers can only be moved to adjacent cells (horizontally or vertically).

# Game Rules:

- Players can only move numbers to adjacent empty cells (left, right, up, or down).
- Diagonal moves are not allowed.
- The objective is to arrange a grid of numbers in ascending order, but the catch is that numbers can only be moved to adjacent cells (horizontally or vertically). This limitation makes the game incredibly tough, requiring careful planning and strategic thinking.

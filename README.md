# Game Rules:

- Players can only move numbers to adjacent empty cells (left, right, up, or down).
- Diagonal moves are not allowed.
- The objective is to arrange a grid of numbers in ascending order, but the catch is that numbers can only be moved to adjacent cells (horizontally or vertically). This limitation makes the game incredibly tough, requiring careful planning and strategic thinking.

## Overview

"Number Grid Challenge" is a deceptively simple-looking game that offers an incredibly challenging experience. The objective is to arrange a grid of numbers in ascending order, but the catch is that numbers can only be moved to adjacent cells (horizontally or vertically). This limitation makes the game incredibly tough, requiring careful planning and strategic thinking.

## Features

- **Number Grid:** The game presents players with a 4x4 grid filled with randomized numbers, typically ranging from 1 to 16 (or higher for a more difficult version).

- **Movement Rules:** Players can only move numbers to adjacent empty cells (left, right, up, or down). Diagonal moves are not allowed.

- **Objective:** The goal is to arrange the numbers in ascending order within a specified number of moves. For instance, you might have to complete the grid in as few as 30 moves to win.

- **Limited Moves:** Players have a limited number of moves or "swaps" to achieve the correct order. This adds an extra layer of complexity and strategy.

- **Hints:** Offer a limited number of hints or undo moves for players who get stuck.
